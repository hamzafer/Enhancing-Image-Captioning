# Enhancing Image Captioning with Advanced Deep Learning Techniques

**Collaborators:** Anna, Kimia, Hamza  

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the performance and accuracy of image captioning systems by exploring and innovating upon existing methodologies. Building on the foundational work of **"Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions"** by Andrej Karpathy, we reproduce the paper’s results and investigate improvements using modern deep learning techniques such as advanced object detection, transformer models, and semi-supervised learning.

## Key Objectives
1. **Reproducing Karpathy's Paper**: We aim to reproduce the results of Karpathy and Fei-Fei's seminal paper, focusing on image-caption alignment using convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
2. **Exploring Advanced Techniques**: After reproducing the foundational results, we explore newer methodologies:
   - **Object Detection**: Utilizing models like YOLOv5 for more accurate object detection.
   - **Transformer Models**: Implementing transformer architectures for better caption generation.
   - **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combining labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance, especially with limited labeled datasets.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: We evaluate these methods to determine their effectiveness in improving the accuracy, relevance, and richness of generated captions.

## Challenges and Exploration
The main challenge is to first reproduce the results from Karpathy's paper, which requires a deep understanding of visual-semantic alignments. We will then evaluate and innovate on object detection models, transformers, and semi-supervised learning, assessing their potential in enhancing image captioning systems. This project also allows us to delve into advanced deep learning topics such as ResNet, R-CNN, YOLO, and transformers.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Using advanced architectures like ResNet and Inception for feature extraction.
- **Object Detection**: Implementing YOLOv5 for accurate object analysis.
- **Transformer Models**: Leveraging transformer-based architectures for improved caption generation.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combining labeled and unlabeled data to train more robust models.

## Datasets
The following datasets will be used for training and evaluation:
- **MSCOCO Dataset**: [MSCOCO](https://cocodataset.org) – A comprehensive dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.
- **Flickr8k Dataset**: [Flickr8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) – A dataset widely used in the image captioning domain with diverse images and captions.

## Conclusion
This project combines foundational techniques from deep learning with cutting-edge advancements in object detection, transformers, and semi-supervised learning to enhance image captioning systems. Our results and models will contribute towards more accurate and semantically meaningful image descriptions.
